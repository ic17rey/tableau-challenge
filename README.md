# Tableau Challenge

### Challenge Aim
Using public data for NYC Citi Bikes available at [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data), visualizations are created in Tableau and gathered into a story. Focus of the data analysis will be for bike rentals in Jersey City for spring and summer months of 2019 and 2020. Data is explored for pre-pandemic trends as compared to trends in 2020. The data collected for 2021 differs and will not be utilized. Visualizations for each discovered phenomena are combined into dashboards, and the dashboards are used to construct the story.

### Trends identified
The number of bike rentals during the spring and summer of 2020 was considerably less than the bike rentals for the same months in 2019. Core ridership ages seem to be 25 to 39 for both years, although the 50 to 54 age group saw a significant increase in number of rentals during 2020 (while across nearly all other age groups rentals were significantly decreasing). An apparent trend during these warm weather months of 2020, the rental trip durations were averaging much longer than across the same months in 2019.
